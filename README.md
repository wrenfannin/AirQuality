# Air Quality 
## Prerequisites
 - Latest version of python
 - PySerial library - https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html#installation
 - Air quality sensor kit from Dyson - https://www.jamesdysonfoundation.co.uk/resources/secondary-school-resources/engineering-solutions-air-pollution.html
 - Latest version of Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/
 - Free USB port 
## Known Issues
 - On some Linux systems the user does not have permissions to read the serial port - https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016495679-Fix-port-access-on-Linux
 - If installing PySerial with pip via a terminal, make sure to [install PySerial and NOT Serial] as they are different libraries
 - If editiing arduino code, there may be an error message caused by having the wrong library version, [ensure to have the V1.0 version of the right library]

## Installation 
 - Assemble the Arduino with the provided shield as in the picture below [IMAGE HERE]
